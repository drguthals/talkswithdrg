# Talks with Dr. G

Thanks for attending one of my talks! 

Here you will find resources for talks that I have given. For talks that introduce GitHub, I usually have a way for you to add your name to show you attended (and so that you can try out your first PR (pull request) in a safe place :) )

Find the event+talk below for more information!
