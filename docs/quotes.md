Keeping track of little quips and quotes I say is hard...so I made this!

"Computer Science for All" doesn't mean that everyone needs to be a developer. It means that every person should have the access, opportunity, and support to learn the 
fundamentals of computer science to apply it to their own lives. Code is prolific in almost every aspect of your life, even if you're not directly engaging with it. Learning to 
harness tech as a tool to design your solutions is the goal. 

Don't be afraid to leverage your growth and change to make new choices to improve your life. While each step may not be the most sparkly, as 
long as you continuously check in with yourself and ensure you're still on your own personal journey, you will get there. Find your community and support and push through
the barriers. And when you need to, rest.
