Very helpful talk, Sarah! I've used Git and GitHub for a while, but never really understood
the workflow of branches. The link to and explanation of "Understanding the GitHub flow" 
was informative, and worth the time to attend. I've created an Edge "Collection" with the 
links you shared for future reference.

Great talk, Sarah. I already have some experience with Git and GitHub, but still learned something about GitHub desktop and the extension for VS Code. Thanks!

I really enjoyed your session Dr. G!  I have been hesitant to use git for years because I never really understood it.  Thanks for putting together this clear and concise session!
