Very helpful talk, Sarah! I've used Git and GitHub for a while, but never really understood
the workflow of branches. The link to and explanation of "Understanding the GitHub flow" 
was informative, and worth the time to attend. I've created an Edge "Collection" with the 
links you shared for future reference.
