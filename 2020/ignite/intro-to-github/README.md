# Intro to GitHub

GitHub has long served as one of the most popular collaboration tools for developers. Even so, developing software in collaboration with others can get complicated and confusing. In this session, you will be introduced to the basics of GitHub and the collaboration workflow and learn the importance of version control even for personal projects. Join us to explore the GitHub toolset and begin leveraging it for your own development and collaboration needs.
