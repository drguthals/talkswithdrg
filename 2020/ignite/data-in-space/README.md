# The Data Behind Space Exploration with NASA
Data science is a field that influences all aspects of our scientific community, including space exploration. Inspired by NASA, we’ve developed new content for analyzing space rocks and determining the likelihood of a successful rocket launch into space. Join this session to explore this data and to perhaps develop your own space exploration study using Visual Studio Code and a bit of Python. This session recommends a basic understanding of Visual Studio Code and Python programming.

There are three deliveries for this session:
